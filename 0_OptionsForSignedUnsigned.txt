Option 0: Do nothing, try to live with the Synopsys includes
 

Option 1: 
 * Keep only std_logic_vector as IO,
 * Add an option to declare() for signed / unsigned / std_logic_vector
    (Should the default be std_logic_vector or unsigned?)
 * Manually edit _all_ the operators to add conversions.
 * No need to edit the TestBench architecture

Option 2
 Same as Option 1, but allow signed/unsigned IOs
 * Need to edit the TestBench architecture
 * Cleaner but adds more coding. For instance, in Table, need to manage the types of IOs.
