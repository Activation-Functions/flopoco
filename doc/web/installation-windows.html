	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	During this process, you will need an internet connection.<br><br>
	To get started, go ahead and install these tools : 
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a></li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a></li>
	  <li>A SSH Client. If you are running Linux or Mac, you already have one. If you are using Windows, I recommended you "Putty".</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<h1>Let's go ! </h1>
	
	<h2>Create a project</h2>
	Now that you have all set it up, create a folder where you want. It will contain all the Vagrant files.
	
	<h2>Open a command prompt</h2>
	Open a command prompt and go into the folder you create. If you are using windows, you can quickly open a command prompt to your project by holding down shift and right-clicking the project folder, then choose “open command window here”.
	
	<h2>Launch commands</h2>
	Now type the following commands :
	<ul>
		<li>vagrant init ubuntu/trusty32</li>
		<li>vagrant up : the first time, it may take some time depending on your internet connection.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>SSH part</h2>
	You have two solutions at this point :
	<ul>
		<li>Using your favorite ssh client, connect to your virtual machine with the following parameters :
		<ul>
			<li>Adress : 127.0.0.1</li>
			<li>Port : The port is given during the execution of "vagrant up". By default 2222.</li>
			<li>Login : vagrant</li>
			<li>Password : vagrant</li>
		</ul></li>
		
		<li>You can also try to type "vagrant ssh" in your prompt, sometime it works. The result is the same thing.
		</ul></li>
	
	<h2>Updating your virtual machine</h2>
	Now that your are connected to your virtual machine, type the following commands :
	<ul>
		<li>sudo apt-get update</li>
		<li>sudo apt-get upgrade</li>
	</ul>
	If a prompt asks you something, just press "y".
	
	<h2>Installing Flopoco on your virtual machine</h2>
	Using your browser, go to this <a href="http://flopoco.gforge.inria.fr/flopoco_user_manual.html">page</a> :
	Copy the last one-line installation script and paste it into the prompt of your virtual machine.
	Wait. Sometime, you will be asked to press "y".
	
	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	It should work. If not, try to understand why it does not work and try to fix it by yourself.
	If you are not able to fix the problem, feel free to ask us some help.
	
	<h2>Some common problems</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>You can not acess the VM using SSH : open VirtualBox, click right on your Vagrant Machine in the list, and shutdown and restart the VM.</li>
		<li>During the execution of "vagrant up", the script loops trying to access the Vm using ssh : Don't worry (be happy), Stop the script. And restart your virtual machine directly into VirtualBox.</li>
		<li>If you have some problems when "vagrant up" and using Linux, try to run the commands as root.</li>
		<li>If nothing work, just reboot your computer. Reboot solves more or less everything.</li>
	</ul>
	If you encountered others problems, give us feedback and if possible solutions so that we can add them to the preceeding list.
