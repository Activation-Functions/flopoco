<h2>What is this Tobin Tax license nonsense?</h2>

<p>In recent years, more and more of the financial transactions have
been purely speculative, taking a parasitic tax on the productive
economy without providing any service to society at large. In
addition, these activities have gone completely out of democratic
control. The latest nuisance of this kind is high-speed trading, where
computers are used to instantly respond to each tiny fluctuations of
the market with massive transaction orders. A computer can perform way
more transactions that a human operator can control, and this is
becoming a major source of economic instability, as illustrated by the
2009 crisis.
</p>

<p>The computers are actually used for short-term market predictions,
then all the lemmings want to sell or buy at the same time, therefore
the fastest wins. Financial banks have therefore recently become a
major consumer of computing power, including FPGA computing, and of
course they do have money to fund our research. We truly believe
FloPoCo could be useful here, we know it is full of interesting
research problems, and still we don't believe it would be a good
thing.
</p>

<p>
In 1972, economist and "Nobel" Prize winner James Tobin suggested that
taxing all the financial transactions at a very low rate would harm
speculation more than useful finance. The applicability of this idea
can be disputed (and has been even by Mr Tobin himself, see the fairly
balanced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin_tax">Wikipedia
page</a>). Let us try it on FloPoCo.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the license on FloPoCo-generated operators reads:
<em>For any financial transaction performed on the basis of
information computed using at least one operator generated by FloPoCo,
a fee of 0.1% (one tenth of a percent) of the amount of the
transaction is due to each of the public organisations that funded
FloPoCo (...).</em> </p>

<p>
 It should be clear that we don't really expect to get rich this
way. If FloPoCo were to be used for this kind of applications, the
amount due to us would be ridiculous. Just 0.1% as ridiculous as the
amounts of money that run in circles in these transactions.
</p>

<p>
This restricted license applies to version 1.15.2 and following of FloPoCo.</p>
