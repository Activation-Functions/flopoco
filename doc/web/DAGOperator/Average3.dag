# This example is small and stupid but at least its pipeline works :)

# Declare parameters (int or string should work)
# The idea is that you may explore different values of the parameters by changing just a few lines here.

Parameter wE = 7;
Parameter wF = 17; 


# Declare the FloPoCo operators you will use, using command-line syntax
# The same operator may be used several times, instances in the VHDL will have a unique id appended
# Here the idea is that you may explore different variants of the operators easily

Operator Add   : FPAdd wE = $wE wF = $wF;
Operator Div3   : FPConstDiv wE = $wE wF = $wF d=3;

# Declare Input/Output signals -- these will be the IOs of the top-level entity

Input A, B, C;
Output S;

# Assemble the operators

S <= Div3(Add(Add(A,B), C));
