<h1>FloPoCo user manual</h1>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>FloPoCo depends on the MPFR library, available from <a
href="http://www.mpfr.org">http://www.mpfr.org</a> and probably available in
your favourite Linux/Unix distribution. To compile it you need CMake (<a
href="http://www.cmake.org/">http://www.cmake.org/</a>) which also comes
prepackaged for mainstream Linux/Unix distributions.</p>

<p>Compilation is a two-step process:</p>

<p><code>cmake .</code></p>

<p><code>make</code></p>

<p>The adventurous may get FloPoCo from its <a
href="https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=1030">subversion
repository</a>.</p>

<h2>Command-line interface</h2>

<p>FloPoCo is a command-line tool. The general syntax is</p>

<p><code>flopoco &lt;options&gt; &lt;operator specification
list&gt;</code></p>

<p>FloPoCo will generate a single VHDL file (named by default
<code>flopoco.vhdl</code>) containing synthesisable descriptions of all the
operators listed in <code>&lt;operator specification list&gt;</code>, plus
possibly sub-operators instanciated by them. To use these operators in your
design, just add this generated file to your project.</p>

<p>FloPoCo will also issue a report with useful information about the generated operators, such as the pipeline depth or expected working frequency.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p><code>./flopoco IntConstMult 16 12345</code></p>

<p>produces a file <code>flopoco.vhdl</code> containing a single operator for
the integer multiplication of an input 16-bit number by the constant 12345.
The VHDL entity is named after the operator specification, here
<code>IntConstMult_16_12345</code>.</p>

<p><code>./flopoco IntConstMult 16 12345 IntConstMult 16 54321</code></p>

<p>produces a file <code>flopoco.vhdl</code> containing two VHDL entities and
their architectures, for the two given constant multipliers. </p>

<p><code>./flopoco FPConstMult 8 23 8 23 0 -50 1768559438007110</code></p>

<p>produces a file flopoco.vhdl containing two VHDL entities, one for the
specified constant floating-point multiplier by 1768559438007110.2-50, and
the other one for a needed sub-component (an integer multiplier for the
significand multiplication).</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>Several options are available and will typically change the operators
occuring after them in the list. For instance <code>-frequency=300</code>
sets the target frequency.</p>

<h3>Built-in help</h3>

<p>To obtain a concise list of the available operators and options, simply
type</p>

<p><code>./flopoco </code></p>

<p>In addition this help may be more in sync with the code than this file,
especially if you are using a svn snpashot.</p>

<h3>Helper programs</h3>

<p>The FloPoCo distributions also includes useful programs for converting the
binary string of a floating-point number to human-readable form
(<code>bin2fp</code>) and back (<code>fp2bin</code>). The
<code>longacc2fp</code> utility converts the fixed-point output of the
LongAcc operator (see below) to human-readable form.</p>

<h2>Available operators</h2>

<p>This list may not be fully up-to date... the code is the reference.</p>

<h3>Useful building blocks for FP operators</h3>

<p>The following operators are available.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>LeftShifter wIn MaxShift</code> </dt>
    <dd>Left barrel shifter. It has two inputs, the data to shift and a shift
      value. The width of the latter is deduced from MaxShift, which is the
      maximum shift distance. This operator will be pipelined to match target
      frequency.</dd>
  <dt><code>RightShifter wIn MaxShift</code> </dt>
    <dd>Same, but to the right.</dd>
  <dt><code>LZOC wIn wOut</code></dt>
    <dd>Leading Zero/One Counter (mostly untested).</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Pipelined integer standard operators</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><code>IntAdder wIn</code></dt>
    <dd>Integer adder. In modern VHDL, integer addition is expressed by a +
      and one usually needn't define an entity for it. However, this operator
      will be pipelined if the addition is too large to be performed at the
      target frequency. Works pretty well on Virtex4.</dd>
  <dt><code>IntMultiplier wInX wInY</code></dt>
    <dd>Same for multiplication, although the frequency attainable will be
      limited by the DSP blocks available. wInX and wInY are the input widths
      of both operands. This is an unsigned operation.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Classical floating-point operators</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><code>FPMultiplier wEX wFX wEY wFY wER wFR</code></dt>
    <dd>A floating-point multiplier, with pepper: it may multiply number of
      different precisions, and provide you with the correct rounding to
      arbitrary precision -- including an exact result if wFR is larger than
      wFX+wFY+1.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Long fixed-point accumulator</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><code>LongAcc wE_in wF_in MaxMSB_in LSB_acc MSB_acc</code></dt>
    <dd>This operator is described in all the gory details in <a
      href="http://prunel.ccsd.cnrs.fr/ensl-00268348/">this article</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Constant multipliers</h3>

<p>This family of operators is described in all the gory details in <a
href="http://prunel.ccsd.cnrs.fr/ensl-00269219/">this article</a>.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>IntConstMult w c</code></dt>
    <dd>integer constant multiplier: w is input size, c is the constant.</dd>
  <dt><code>FPConstMult wE_in wF_in wE_out wF_out cst_sgn cst_exp
  cst_int_sig</code></dt>
    <dd>floating-point constant multiplier. The constant is provided as sign,
      integral significand and integral exponent.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Miscellanous</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><code>Wrapper entity_name</code></dt>
    <dd>Produce a wrapper named entity_name for the preceding operator
      (useful to get synthesis results without having the operator optimised
      out)</dd>
</dl>
