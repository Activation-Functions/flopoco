Get rid of the useBitHeap arg in KCMs

- Interface to FunctionTable has changed deeply, manually convert everything
	 This is triggered by FunctionTable being renamed to FixFunctionByTable
   (not that bad, need to replace wIn with lsbIn=-wIn, and exchange lsbOut and msbOut)

-reverse MSB and LSB in LongAcc etc


- Check all these registered etc nonsense in Signal. Is it really used?
- get rid of use() in Operator
- Check DualTable and DualTable2


- FixSinCos seems never to use its special ConstDiv3 anymore, check that

- DualTable and DualTable2: WTF?
