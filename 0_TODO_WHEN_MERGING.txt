Get rid of the useBitHeap arg in KCMs

- Interface to FunctionTable has changed deeply, manually convert everything
	 This is triggered by FunctionTable being renamed to FixFunctionByTable
   (not that bad, need to replace wIn with lsbIn=-wIn, and exchange lsbOut and msbOut)

-reverse MSB and LSB in LongAcc etc


- Check all these registered etc nonsense in Signal. Is it really used?
- get rid of use() in Operator
- Check DualTable and DualTable2


- FixSinCos seems never to use its special ConstDiv3 anymore, check that


TODOs that will go in the TODO 
- bug  ./flopoco FixSinCos -16 TestBenchFile 1000
  (close corresponding bug when fixed)
- change interface to FixSinCos and CordicSinCos to use lsb and not w
- IntConstMult: signed or unsigned int? (fix main.cpp)
- rounding bug:  ./flopoco FixRealKCM 1 3 -10 -10 "Pi" 1 TestBenchFile 1000
	(close corresponding bug when fixed)
- IntSquarer should be made non-xilinx-specific, and bitheapized
- Same for IntKaratsuba and FPKaratsuba, which have been disabled completely
- simple and expert versions of IntMultiplier
- Check IntDualSub situation
- Merge AM work into IntConstMult
- resurrect Guillaume's work (IntPower etc)
