This folder contains the version of the CORDIC algorithm with reduced number of iterations.

It results in a smaller size, but produces slower circuits; -> both by about a factor of 2.

To use this version, just replace the equivalent files with these ones (temporary solution, will be fixed for smething more elegant shortly).
