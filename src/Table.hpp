/**
 A basic hardware look-up table for FloPoCo.

	 If the input to your table are negative, etc, or if you want to
	 define errors, or... then derive a class from this one.

	 A Table is, so far, always combinatorial. It does increase the critical path,
	 taking into account inputDelays and reporting outputDelay.

	 On logic tables versus blockRam tables:
	 This has unfortunately to be managed twice,
	   firstly by passing the proper bool value to the logicTable argument of the constructor
	   and  secondly by calling useSoftRAM() or useHardRAM() on each instance to set the synthesis attributes.

	 You may want to force buffering the inputs to a table to be sure it will be synthesized as a BlockRAM.
