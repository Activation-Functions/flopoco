/*
 This version of the Operator class is in a transitional state.
 It contains methods for both the new pipeline framework (pipeline made easy)
 and the old one (flagged as DEPRECATED). 
 The developer manual describes only the new approach, which is so much better
  (much shorter code and very easy pipeline setup).

 Beware, when cut'n-pasting from existing code, that an operator should not mix both approaches.
 The main incompatibility is with delayed signals: in the new framework, a delayed signal is added 
 only once to signalList (by declare())
 and all its delayed versions are generated by buildVHDLSignalDeclarations and buildVHDLRegisters.
 In older versions, signals were added by addSignal(), and delayed signals were replicated in signalList.
