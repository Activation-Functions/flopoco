This directory contains all the classes needed for constant multiplication optimization.

An integer multiplier is a sequence of shift-and-add operations. 

The class ShiftAddOp defines such an operation.
The class ShiftAddDag defines a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of such operations.
The class IntConstMult builds such a DAG for integer multiplication. It inherits Operator.
The class FPConstMult builds an FP constant multiplier using an IntConstMult for the mantissas.
