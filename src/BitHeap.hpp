/* 
   Each bit in the bit heap is flagged with the cycle at which it is produced.
   Compression works as follows:

   First check if there are DSP blocks, chain them into supertiles, generate the corresponding VHDL, and add the result to the bit heap
   Then, compress the bit heap




   setCycle(0)
   while needed
   manageCriticalPath() to advance the cycle  
   consider the subset of bits with cycles 0 to getCycle()
   build the longest possible heap of size 2 or less from the right,
   and feed them to an adder.
   compress the others bits greedily, 
   adding more bits, flagged with the current cycle, 
   setting the cycle of the consumed bits to -1 so they won't be considered in subsequent iterations
