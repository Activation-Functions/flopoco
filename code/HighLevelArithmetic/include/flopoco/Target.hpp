	This class unfortunately mixes up two notions:

	- features of the hardware target, in particular FPGA ones, and methods to retrieve them and / or exploit them.
	These are defined statically and users are not expected to modify them.
	Among these features, many describe the delays associated to various computations. They are intended to be used as first argument of declare() in order to build self-pipelining operators.

	- methods to set and retreive VHDL generation objectives:
    features of the generated code (e.g. do you want clock enable signals) 
	  cost/performance objectives (e.g. frequency, DSP utilization threshold, etc.)
