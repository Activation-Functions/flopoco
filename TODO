TODO file for FloPoCo

Pipeline framework, Operator and Targets:
* add one Altera target
* complete test bench generation
* replace the _d_d_d_d names with shorter, index-based ones.
* get the constants right to have a better evaluation of the frequency of the shifters
* manage a notion of cycle at the Operator level?
* remove the lutsize option, and replace them with a target option.

Tools:
* add NaN and infty handling in fp2bin bin2fp longacc2fp

ConstMult:
* implement KCM algorithm and select it if it means less hardware
    (it should for small wX/large constants)
* pipeline IntConstMult then FPConstMult.
* Implement the continued fraction stuff for FPCRConstMult

LongAcc:
* pipeline accumulation itself
* pipeline 2's complement
* add overflow flags

FPMultiplier:
* pipeline final addition
* refine the DSP model in Targets

SumOfProducts
* to write completely

Shifters
* provide finer spec, see the TODOs inside Shifter.cpp

General
* Doxygenize while it's not too late

Tentative roadmap:

Version 0.1: IntConstMult, FPConstMult, FPCRConstMult
Version 0.4: LongAccumulator, FPMultiplier
Version ?? : HOTBM integration 
Version ?? : FPLog
Version ?? : FPExp
Version 1.0: Add all the FPLibrary operators, with asymetric IO sizes
