TODO file for FloPoCo


General:
pipeline HOTBM, FPExp, FPLog
add FPSquareRoot

Pipeline framework, Operator and Targets:
* Clean up deprecated methods
* uniformize declare and addInput, so that use() may be invoked on input signals
* finetune Altera target


ConstMult:
* upgrade to the new pipeline framework
* implement KCM algorithm and select it if it means less hardware
    (it will for small wX/large constants)
* For FPConstMult, don't output the LSBs of the IntConstMult 
   but only their sticky
* Try left to right and right to left; try variations of the initial recoding
* more clever, Lefevre-inspired algorithm
* Use DSP: find the most interesting constant fitting on 18 bits
* compare with Spiral.net
* Implement the continued fraction stuff for FPCRConstMult

FPAdder
* clean up the input parameters of FPAdder, for instance wEX and wEY should
be replaced by wE
* a few optimization opportunities, see the TODO inside FPAdder.cpp

FPMultiplier:
* Cleaning up and rewriting in the new pipeline framework
* refine the DSP model in Targets/StratixII

SumOfProducts
* add test bench generation

Shifters
* provide finer spec, see the TODOs inside Shifter.cpp

General
* Doxygenize while it's not too late

Tentative roadmap 
(version number count, more or less, the number of working operators):

Version 0.1: IntConstMult, FPConstMult, FPCRConstMult
Version 0.4: LongAccumulator, FPMultiplier
Version 0.5 : HOTBM integration 
Version 0.6 : FPLog
Version 0.7 : FPExp
Version 0.8 : DotProduct
Version 0.9 : LNS operators, thanks to Sylvain Collange
Version 0.11:   FPDiv, IntSquarer, new pipeline framework
-- we're here (faster than expected)
Version 1.0   FPSqrt
Version ???   FPAddSub (for FFT butterfly structure)
Version ???   FixToFPUniformDist (2008 ASAP paper by Thomas with improvements)
Version ???   FPSquarer
Version ???   FPNorm2D
Version ???   FPNorm3D
Version ???   FPSinCos
Version ??    FPBoxMuller
Version ???   Interval operators

We'll leave 0.xx for 1.xx when all the FPLibrary operators are backported with working pipeline
