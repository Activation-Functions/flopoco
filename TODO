TODO file for FloPoCo


General:
pipeline HOTBM, FPExp, FPLog

Pipeline framework, Operator and Targets:
* Clean up deprecated methods
* finetune Altera target

FPAdder
* clean up the input parameters of FPAdder, for instance wEX and wEY should
be replaced by wE
* a few optimization opportunities, see the TODO inside FPAdder.cpp
* implement a single-path version

FPMultiplier:
* Cleaning up and rewriting in the new pipeline framework
* refine the DSP model in Targets


ConstMult:
* implement KCM algorithm and select it if it means less hardware
    (it will for small wX/large constants)
* For FPConstMult, don't output the LSBs of the IntConstMult 
   but only their sticky
* Try left to right and right to left; try variations of the initial recoding
* more clever, Lefevre-inspired algorithm
* Use DSP: find the most interesting constant fitting on 18 bits
* compare with Spiral.net
* Implement the continued fraction stuff for FPCRConstMult

SumOfProducts
* add test bench generation

Shifters
* provide finer spec, see the TODOs inside Shifter.cpp

General
* Doxygenize while it's not too late
* replace all the cout messages by cerr ones

Tentative roadmap 
(minor version number count, more or less, the number of working operators. 
We have left  0.xx for 1.xx when all the basic operators have been backported with working pipeline):

Version 0.1: IntConstMult, FPConstMult, FPCRConstMult
Version 0.4: LongAccumulator, FPMultiplier
Version 0.5 : HOTBM integration 
Version 0.6 : FPLog
Version 0.7 : FPExp
Version 0.8 : DotProduct
Version 0.9 : LNS operators, thanks to Sylvain Collange
Version 0.11:   FPDiv, IntSquarer, new pipeline framework
Version 1.15   FPSqrt FPSquarer InputIEEE Fix2FP 
-- we're here (faster than expected)
Version ???   FPAddSub (for FFT butterfly structure)
Version ???   FixToFPUniformDist (2008 ASAP paper by Thomas with improvements)
Version ???   FPNorm2D
Version ???   FPNorm3D
Version ???   FPSinCos
Version ??    FPBoxMuller
Version ???   Interval operators
