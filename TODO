TODO file for FloPoCo


General:
pipeline FPConstMult, HOTBM, FPExp, FPLog
add FPDivider and FPSquareRoot

Pipeline framework, Operator and Targets:
* finetune Altera target
* replace the _d_d_d_d names with shorter, index-based ones.
* get the constants right to have a better evaluation of the frequency of the shifters
* manage a notion of cycle at the Operator level?
* add an output_vhdl_instance method to Operator? Not sure.


ConstMult:
* implement KCM algorithm and select it if it means less hardware
    (it should for small wX/large constants)
* For FPConstMult, don't output the LSBs of the IntConstMult 
   but only their sticky
* Try left to right and right to left
* Use DSP: find the most interesting constant fitting on 18 bits
* Implement the continued fraction stuff for FPCRConstMult

LongAcc:
* add test bench generation
* add overflow flags

FPMultiplier:
* refine the DSP model in Targets/StratixII

SumOfProducts
* add test bench generation

Shifters
* provide finer spec, see the TODOs inside Shifter.cpp

General
* Doxygenize while it's not too late

Tentative roadmap 
(version number count, more or less, the number of working operators):

Version 0.1: IntConstMult, FPConstMult, FPCRConstMult
Version 0.4: LongAccumulator, FPMultiplier
Version 0.5 : HOTBM integration 
Version 0.6 : FPLog
Version 0.7 : FPExp
Version 0.8 : DotProduct
-- we're here (much faster than expected)
Version ???   FPAddSub (for FFT butterfly structure)
Version ???   FixToFPUniformDist (2008 ASAP paper by Thomas with improvements)
Version ???   FPSquarer
Version ???   FPNorm2D
Version ???   FPNorm3D
Version ???   FPSinCos
Version ??    FPBoxMuller
Version ???   Interval operators

We'll leave 0.xx for 1.xx when all the FPLibrary operators are backported with working pipeline
