TODO file for FloPoCo


General:
pipeline HOTBM, FPExp, FPLog
add FPDivider and FPSquareRoot

Pipeline framework, Operator and Targets:
* remove getTestIOMap which should be automatic when we do addInput etc
* refactor test bench generation for better support of operator-specific cases
* better evaluation of the frequency of the shifters and LZOCs 
* finetune Altera target
* get rid of _d in the outputVHDL codes, replace them with getDelaySignalName
* before or after, rename getDelaySignalName() into D() for code readability
* Then replace the _d_d_d_d names with shorter, index-based ones.
* manage a notion of cycle at the Operator level?
   => Add automatic or semi-automatic synchro checking (not clear yet how)
* add slack delay information


ConstMult:
* implement KCM algorithm and select it if it means less hardware
    (it should for small wX/large constants)
* For FPConstMult, don't output the LSBs of the IntConstMult 
   but only their sticky
* Try left to right and right to left
* Use DSP: find the most interesting constant fitting on 18 bits
* Implement the continued fraction stuff for FPCRConstMult

FPAdder
* a few optimization opportunities, see the TODO inside FPAdder.cpp

FPMultiplier:
* Cleaning up
* refine the DSP model in Targets/StratixII

SumOfProducts
* add test bench generation

Shifters
* provide finer spec, see the TODOs inside Shifter.cpp

General
* Doxygenize while it's not too late

Tentative roadmap 
(version number count, more or less, the number of working operators):

Version 0.1: IntConstMult, FPConstMult, FPCRConstMult
Version 0.4: LongAccumulator, FPMultiplier
Version 0.5 : HOTBM integration 
Version 0.6 : FPLog
Version 0.7 : FPExp
Version 0.8 : DotProduct
Version 0.9 : LNS operators, thanks to Sylvain Collange
-- we're here (much faster than expected)
Version ???   FPDiv, FPSqrt
Version ???   FPAddSub (for FFT butterfly structure)
Version ???   FixToFPUniformDist (2008 ASAP paper by Thomas with improvements)
Version ???   FPSquarer
Version ???   FPNorm2D
Version ???   FPNorm3D
Version ???   FPSinCos
Version ??    FPBoxMuller
Version ???   Interval operators

We'll leave 0.xx for 1.xx when all the FPLibrary operators are backported with working pipeline
