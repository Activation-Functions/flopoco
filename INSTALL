Installation Instructions
*************************

Dependencies:

FloPoCo uses CMake, which is available for most Unix and Linux
distributions and for Windows. 

FloPoCo depends on MPFR, which is available for most Unices. On
Debian and derivative, the package to install is libmpfr-dev.
See www.mpfr.org for other systems.

Compilation:
On Linux/unix, type in a terminal:

cmake .
make

then try 
./flopoco 

In principle CMake also generates MSVisual C++ project files, but this
has not been tested.
