Installation Instructions
*************************

try "make"...

If it fails, FloPoCo uses CMake, which is available for most Unix and Linux
distributions and for Windows. Build the Makefile using 
"cmake ." in the FloPoCo directory.

FloPoCo depends on MPFR, which is available for most Unices. On
Debian and derivative, the package to install is libmpfr-dev.
See www.mpfr.org for other systems.
