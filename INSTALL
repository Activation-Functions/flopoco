Installation Instructions
*************************

FloPoCo may be compiled either using CMake or the autotools. 
The recommended way is CMake, which is available for most Unix and
Linux distributions and for Windows. See below.

If you prefer to use the autotools, uncompress autotools-files.tgz and
read the README.autotools file it contains.

Dependencies:

FloPoCo depends on MPFR, which is available for most Unices. On
Debian and derivative, the package to install is libmpfr-dev.
See www.mpfr.org for other systems.

For HOTBM support, you need also to install libsollya from the Sollya tool
http://sollya.gforge.inria.fr/ 
Please note that libsollya is not stable, so interface changes might
break FloPoCo compilation. If this is the case, try to download r588
of libsollya from the SVN repository.


Compilation using CMake:
On Linux/unix, type in a terminal:

cmake .
make

then try 
./flopoco 

CMake also generates MSVisual C++ project files. This should work (it has worked
each time we tried), but we do not test it as systematically.
